* 🥇**These two simple Five-In-Row and Three-In_Row are based on α-β Pruning algorithm**
* 🐊**Using CodeBlocks to develop**
* Two Steps to Run Source Code:
  - Download .cpp file
  - Open and run in CodeBlocks or other IDE
* Future Improvement: Add User Interface(UI, maybe based on QT)
* Any communication and help is welcome 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
